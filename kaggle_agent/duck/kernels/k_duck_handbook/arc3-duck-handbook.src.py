# Tufa Labs ARC3 submission

![Tufa Labs](attachment:tufa_labs.png)

**Note**: this notebook is a more readable version of the notebook that scored our milestone-winning 1.21; unfortunately, we haven't had the same lucky result with this one. The original one is also shared here, but using it is not recommended: https://www.kaggle.com/code/jeroencottaar/taaf-duck-harness-kaggle

**Note**: if you make a copy of this notebook, you will have to manually select the proper GPU (RTX Pro 6000).

This notebook executes the ARC-AGI-3 solver written by the Tufa Labs team; in alphabetical order: Harold Bessis, Jeroen Cottaar, Isaiah Pressman, Andries Smit, Michal Tesnar, and Stefano Viel.

You will only find infrastructure and diagnostics in this notebook; the actual solver code is in an attached dataset. See our writeup on the competition forum to learn more about that the solver actually does.

It installs the ARC runtime from the competition wheelhouse, makes the bundled source
snapshot importable, runs any solver setup commands, loads the pickled benchmark, plays the
competition games, and writes results to `/kaggle/working`. Diagnostics are minimised during
a real competition rerun (`KAGGLE_IS_COMPETITION_RERUN`) and kept full otherwise.

## 1. Environment and submission mode

Detect whether this is a real competition rerun (which minimises diagnostics), set the
framework's environment flags, and put the CUDA libraries on the linker path.

has no internet).

## 5. Load the benchmark

## 6. Customization hook

Optional: tweak `bm`, `bm.games`, or `bm.solver` here before the run starts — the safe place
for one-off experiments once the deployed bundle has loaded.

# Make one-off changes to `bm`, `bm.games`, or `bm.solver` here before the run starts.

## 7. Run the benchmark

In a real competition rerun (`KAGGLE_IS_COMPETITION_RERUN`), wait for the Kaggle gateway and
play the **live competition Arcade**. Otherwise — an interactive "Save & Run" — play the
competition's **bundled environment files offline**, with no gateway required, so the notebook
runs end-to-end without a submission. Teardown commands run afterward even if the run raises.

# Build the live competition game list from the gateway's available environments.
